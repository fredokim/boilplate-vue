 * What a failed request means to the person looking at it.
 *
 * The three boilerplates classify failures three different ways -- this one has
 * `kind: "auth"`, Next has `origin: "auth"` and `kind: "unauthorized"`, Vue has
 * `kind: "http_status"` -- and each grew its own wording, so the same outage
 * read differently depending on which app you happened to open. Unifying the
 * internal types would mean rewriting the error plumbing in all three for no
 * behaviour change. What is worth unifying is the part a person sees.
 *
 * So this file is the contract: the same nine situations, the same words, in
 * every repository. Each one translates its own error type into a key here.
