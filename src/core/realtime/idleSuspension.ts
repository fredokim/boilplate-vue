/**
 * Closes a realtime connection that nobody is watching, and reopens it when
 * somebody is.
 *
 * An open WebSocket is continuous inbound traffic. A host that suspends idle
 * instances therefore never suspends one while a single forgotten tab holds a
 * socket open: the tab costs the same as a tab in active use, all night. The
 * spin-down is the whole economics of a free instance, and a socket quietly
 * opts out of it.
 *
 * Two timeouts rather than one, because "nobody is watching" has two shapes:
 *
 * - The tab is hidden. Nobody is watching by definition, and the only event that
 *   can arrive is the one that says it became visible again. A minute is
 *   generous.
 * - The tab is visible and untouched. Somebody may well be reading it, so this
 *   waits much longer; the cost of being wrong is a visible reconnect.
 *
 * Resuming is driven by real input rather than a poll, so the connection comes
 * back on the same gesture that means someone returned.
