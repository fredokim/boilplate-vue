 * What a connection state means to the person looking at it.

 * "disconnected" or "reconnecting" — the names the code uses, offered to
 * someone who did not write it. That was tolerable while every disconnection
 * was a fault. It stopped being tolerable when the socket started releasing
 * itself on purpose: `disconnected` then covered both "this broke" and "we let
 * it go because nobody was watching", and the reader had no way to tell which.
 *
 * `suspended` is the state that separates them, and this table is what turns
 * any of them into a sentence.
