/**
 * Ensures a token refresh happens once, however many requests hit 401 together.
 *
 * The failure this prevents is specific and easy to reach: a page fires five
 * requests on load, all five 401 on an expired token, all five call refresh.
 * With a rotating refresh token that is not merely wasteful — the first refresh
 * rotates the token and the other four present one that has already been spent,
 * which the server correctly reads as a replay and answers by revoking the
 * whole session family. Five parallel refreshes sign the user out.
 *
 * So the first caller performs the refresh and every other caller awaits the
 * same promise.
 *
 * Ported from the React boilerplate, which shares this backend.
