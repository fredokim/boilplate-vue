 *   event look like an unknown entity and the graph quietly stops updating.
 *
 * Nothing was checking. The transport did `parsed as ServerMessage` and handed
 * whatever arrived to the runtime store, which dedupes on `eventId` and orders
 * on `sequence` — two fields it had no assurance were even present.
 *
 * Written by hand rather than with a DTO class, because the event is a
 * discriminated union and the pairing is the part worth checking: a
 * `NODE_STATUS_CHANGED` carrying `metrics`, or a status this graph has no
 * meaning for, is precisely the "payload applied to the wrong table" that
 * comment is about. A flat DTO cannot say that; the server"s published
 * `TopologyEventDto` types `payload` as an open object for the same reason.
