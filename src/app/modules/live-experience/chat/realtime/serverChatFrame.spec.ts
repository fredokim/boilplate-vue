   * them with initialisers, so `plainToInstance` fills the default and the same
   * response passes with an empty string.
   *
   * Both repositories validate their HTTP responses through the same helper,
   * which means the two disagree about whether a missing field is an error — on
   * every endpoint, not just this frame. The server marks these fields required,
   * so React is accepting responses its own contract says cannot happen.
   *
   * This test pins what this repository actually does. Making the three agree is
   * a change to how every DTO is declared, and its own piece of work.
