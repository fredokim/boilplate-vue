/**
 * One command that says whether this repository is ready to ship.
 *
 * Everything here already existed as an npm script. This adds no new checking —
 * it adds an order, a name for each gate, and a report. The gates are the same
 * ones CI runs, from this list, so the two cannot drift into disagreeing about
 * what "green" means.
 *
 * **Why not `a && b && c`.** `check:ci` was a chain of thirteen scripts joined
 * with `&&`, and it has one failure mode that matters: it stops at the first
 * problem and buries which one it was in several hundred lines of output. That
 * is not hypothetical — a documentation move broke `check:deps`, the chain
 * printed a table of package sizes and an accusation about `hls.js`, and reading
 * the tail of the output gave no hint that the ninth of thirteen steps was the
 * one that failed.
 *
 * So this runs every gate, captures each one’s output separately, and ends with
 * a table. One run tells you everything that is wrong, not the first thing.
 *
 * **Skipping is a result, not a pass.** A gate whose tool is not installed
 * reports `skipped` with the reason and is listed in the summary. Reporting
 * "ready" from a run where four gates never executed is the failure this whole
 * refactor has been about.
