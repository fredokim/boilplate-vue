 * Nothing was checking this, and it had already gone wrong. Next reads two
 * variables that must move together — `BACKEND_URL` decides what the route
 * handlers do, `NEXT_PUBLIC_DATA_MODE` decides which transports the browser
 * builds, and `assertDataModeMatches` refuses a build where they disagree. The
 * example documented one of them. Anyone following it set `BACKEND_URL` alone
 * and hit a build failure explaining a variable they had never been told about;
 * `create-fredo-app` did exactly that on its first CI run.
 *
 * The example is the only place a reader looks for what an app can be
 * configured with. A variable missing from it is undiscoverable until something
 * throws.
 *
 * Only what the *app* reads: `src/` and the build config. A script's own
 * override is not something a person deploying this sets.
