# versions differ in whether they still need that script. A build stage that
# depends on which minor version happens to be pinned is not a build stage.

# The base image puts cap_net_bind_service on /usr/bin/caddy so it can bind
# port 80 without root. Render starts containers with no-new-privileges, and
# execve() of a file carrying file capabilities fails with EPERM under that
# flag: the container never starts, and the only output is
#
#   exec /usr/bin/caddy: operation not permitted
#
# Copying the binary drops the capability -- busybox cp does not carry xattrs --
# and nothing here wants it, because this listens on 8080 rather than on a
# privileged port. The original is removed so there is one binary, not two that
# differ in a way nobody would think to check.

# BACKEND_ORIGIN has no default on purpose. Without it Caddy fails to start,
